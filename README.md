🧩 Rubik’s Cube Solver
This is a simple frontend-only Rubik’s Cube Solver built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It represents a 3x3 Rubik’s Cube, allows manual scrambling, and demonstrates a step-by-step solving process.

The project focuses on:
✅ Object-Oriented design
✅ Cube representation and manipulation logic
✅ A basic solving algorithm (not optimized, but functional)
✅ Fully runnable in the browser without any dependencies

🚀 Demo
👉 Live Demo: https://vikas122002.github.io/rubiks-cube-solver/

📦 Features
🧱 Object-Oriented Cube Representation

🔄 Manual rotation of cube faces

🎲 Random scrambling of the cube

🧠 Simple solving algorithm (for demonstration purposes)

📄 Step-by-step display of solving process

🌐 Works entirely in-browser (no backend or build tools required)

🛠 Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (ES6+)

📌 Notes
This is a demo project to showcase programming and problem-solving skills.

The solving algorithm is not optimized for minimal moves but guarantees a solution.

All rendering is text-based for simplicity (can be extended to graphical representation).

✨ Future Improvements
Add graphical cube rendering with colored squares.

Implement optimal solving algorithms (Kociemba, CFOP, etc.).

Add support for keyboard controls and animations.
